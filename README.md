## How it was built

```
cd server
yarn init -y
yarn add graphql-yoga
cd ..
npx degit https://github.com/jherr/wp5-starter-react.git\#main client
```

- `degit` just does a git clone, then removes the git directory. Then you add the branch you want to copy after the `#` then after a space give the name yo uwant to give the directory.
